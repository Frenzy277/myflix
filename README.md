## Goal and description

The goal of this project is to go beyond a beginner Rails project and learn what it takes to launch real, robust and production quality applications. In this project, I focused on the engineering processes, workflows and best practices of experienced developers. From start to end, I used Test Driven Development (TDD) to build production-level robustness and manage complexity in a growing codebase.

## Main topics, concepts, tech and methodologies used to build this project

### Processes

* Ideation, wireframes, mockups, design and development

* Add features incrementally and deploy continuously

### Team Collaboration

* Feature development with Git branching
* Github flow
* Code reviews

### Testing

* Unit, functional, and integration tests
* Development and test databases
* Shoulda matchers
* TDD and red / green / refactor
